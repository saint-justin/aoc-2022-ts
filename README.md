## Advent of Code 2022 (TypeScript Edition!)
This is a collective of solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022 problemset](https://adventofcode.com/2022). No inputs will be included at the request of the creator. Advent of Code is a short, fun coding adventure by a non-profit as a chance to try something new. I was laid off by Amazon Games in April of 2023, so this repo is my going through and reviewing some fundamentals by way of AoC to brush up for coding tests and whatnot.

Secret note: There's actually 25 days but my initial goal is the first 10 then complete the others in batches of 5.
